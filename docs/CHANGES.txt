Enable 3.2.0 (July 15th, 2009)
==============================

enthought.enable Enhancements
-----------------------------

 * Added Slider and Compass widgets

 * Added an OverlayContainer (almost identical to the one in Chaco)

 * Added ImageGraphicsContextEnable class so that one can always import a Kiva Image backend-based GraphicsContextEnable

 * renaming marker_trait to MarkerTrait (the old name is still permitted forbackwards compatibility, but should be avoided)

 * Moved the scatter_markers module from Chaco to Enable, so that Enable components can use MarkerTrait

 * Added an experimental VTK backend for Enable, along with an example

 * Changed SVGButtonEditor toggle to draw a SVG under the button SVG instead of drawing a plain box

 * Added labels for SVGButton

 * Improving backbuffering performance on the Mac by creating the layer context from the window context instead of from a bitmap.

 * Adding a "fixed_preferred_size" trait to Components, so that relative size preferences can be expressed amongst different components in a container


enthought.enable Fixes
----------------------

 * Improved the backend selection to match the Traits UI backend unless ETSConfig.enable_toolkit is explicitly set

 * Fixed demo_main() in example_support.py so that it doesn't crash IPython

 * Fixed RGBAColorTrait so it can be used with the null toolkit

 * Changed the "sys_window" color to be the same as the Traits UI "WindowColor" constant

 * Fixed backend_cairo's get_text_extent() implementation to match other backends

---------------------------
