* Remove the imports of enthought.tkenable (which does not exist.) from the
    deprecated demos.
* See if we can remove the dependency on enthought.util.  Currently, this is
    only required by two files:
        key_bindings.py imports enthought.util.wx.dialog
        wx_backend/window imports enthought.util.wx.drag_and_drop
